<p>I was born December 28, 1912 in Fresno, California. My father was a laborer. He was a very good masonry man and an excellent carpenter. We worked on many of the buildings in Fresno. When he first came to Fresno he had a job which paid $1.00 a day.</p>
<p>Then he also got an extra job being a lamplighter (street lights). Dad couldn’t speak English but he went to school to learn and became a United States Citizen and so Mom became one automatically a few years later.</p>
<p>When I was about five years old, we moved out to the farm. We had forty acres and we had cattle and alfalfa for a long time. I was the seventh of ten children. We had an old big house which had three bedrooms and a huge hall where some of us slept. It had a big kitchen, porch, service porch and a cellar. We had an outhouse for years and the lights for the house were kerosene lamps. Some time after I left home, after high school, Dad built Mom a new house. Where we lived the community was called Perrin Colony, where practically everyone was related and were Germans.</p>
<p>We spoke German around the house to our parents. I went to a two room schoolhouse and walked to school and came home for lunch. We also had the community church on our property and we all went to church regularly.</p>
<p>I went to Easton High School and traveled by bus, which was about five miles.  When I was sixteen (Minnie was 16 years old in 1929 when the stock market
crashed.) I was an attendant in the Raisin Day Parade. I represented Perrin Colony school house and there was a close runoff. I graduated from Easton High, but my parents could not afford to send me to college, so I went to work.</p>
<p>I did housework and was a live-in housemaid. I worked for one family for a couple of years and helped with the children. When they  moved to Los Angeles, I went with them. I was about twenty then. After I helped them get settled, I got a job as a car-hop in Glendale, and shared an apartment with some girls. I worked for about three years and I also went to Beauty College part time. I only had one hundred hours left to finish the course when I decided to quit. I also quit my job as a car- hop and went to work at the Arsenal, where I met Eddie, who was still married at the time. We dated for about five years before we got married.</p>
<p>We had to work hard on the farm, getting up early and working long hours. We sold the cattle and planted the grape vines.</p>
<p>We kept some land for alfalfa to feed the horses we had.</p>
<p>The vines had to be pruned and the runners were tied on wires, which was very hard on the hands. The grapes had to be picked, spread out on trays, and lined in rows in the sun to dry. After the top was dry they had to be turned, so the other side would dry. If rain came, we’d have to hurry out to the fields and stack the wood trays to get them out of the rain. After the rain we would have to spread the trays all out again. When the grapes were dried on both sides we had to stack them again and leave them in the sun to cure until it was time to haul them in for storage and later sold.</p>
<h3>Additional Notes</h3>
<p>On the 15th of January, 1941, when Minnie was 28 years old, her father, Carl Hartwig (1978-1941) passed away in Fresno, CA.</p>
<p>That same year on 22 September, Minnie (age 28) was married to Melkiah Edward Pope (age 40), in Nevada. Minnie met Eddie while working at the Arsenal as a waitress. Eddie owned the Arsenal and after getting married, Eddie and Minnie kept the restaurant open for several years. John was born during this time and they bought a home and lived in Montrose, CA. Sometime after Barbara was born, Eddie came up with the idea of developing a fishing lure (Hot Shot Fishing Lures). He developed the lure himself, first out of wood then out of solid plastic. It took about 20 hours for the hand-made model.</p>
<p>In 1963, when Minnie was 50, her mother Anna Catharine Roth passed away (1880-1963)</p>
<p>In 1980, on January 11th, Eddie, at the age of 79, (1900-1980) passed away in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
<p>Minnie lived in Mesa until 2000 when she moved to Ogden, Utah to live closer to Barbara.</p>
<p>Minnie passed away on March 4, 2005 in Ogden, Utah.</p>
<p>Minnie always looked beautiful</p>
