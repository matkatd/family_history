<p>Mom’s maiden name was Minnie Hartwig, and she was born 28 Dec 1912 in Fresno, California. My grandfather’s name was Carl Hartwig, and he was born 16 Mar 1876 in Straub, Russia. My Grandma’s maiden name was Anna Catherine Roth. She was born 20 August 1880 in Straub, Russia also. They were German people living in Russia, along the Volga River.</p><p><br></p><p>My Grandpa had 2 brothers and 1 sister. I have never heard about any of them, or about when they came to America, but they are all buried in Fresno, California: Henry, 1873-1912; Johann Daniel, 1865 1938, Katherine Margaretha, 1871-1945. Grandpa died in 1941 before I was born, so I never got to meet him.</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma had 4 brothers and 4 sisters, one of which died at 2 days old and is unnamed in my family records. The information I have for Grandma’s family is very incomplete. There is a brother and a sister who died in 1875 and 1876, the sister at 1 month old, and the brother at 3 years old, both in Straub. My records also indicate that there was a brother that died in 1957 in Placer, California, which is close  to Fresno.</p><p><br></p><p>I think my grandparents got married around 1900, when he was 24 and she was 20. In 1902 they left Russia to come to the United States. They had their first baby with them, Daniel, and he was about one. He died while they were still on the ship, and, sadly, he had to be buried at sea. After they arrived, they settled in Fresno with lots of other Germans from Russia. They lived in town and then eventually Grandpa had a farm. He was a very good masonry man and an excellent carpenter, and helped build many of the brick buildings in town. When he first come to Fresno, he had a job that paid $1.00 a day, and that why he also got a job as a lamplighter, which meant that every night he would go through town lighting the gas street lights, and then in the morning turn them off again. Grandma never did learn to read or write in English, but Grandpa went to school to learn English, and became a United States Citizen. Grandma became one automatically a few years later.</p><p><br></p><p>My mother’s sister, Maria, wrote this about their father:</p><p>“Papa was sent to the town of Warenburg, another village along the Volga, to further his education. That's where he learned to read German with English letters so that after he came to America it was easy for him to learn to read English. He was an avid reader, all his life. As soon as we had finished the dishes at night and cleared off the table, he would spread the newspaper on the table and read every column. He was on the Board of Trustees for the Perrin Colony School for many years. He was a brick mason when he first came to Fresno. When they left for America they went from Straub to Saratov, Russia by train-then to Bremen, Germany by train. By ship to America where they landed at Castle Gardens (Ellis Island) and then by train to California. Took a little over a month on the ship. The tickets were purchased from the F. Miszler Travel Agency in Bremen. It cost about 400 Rubles or $200, including the journey from Straub.”</p><p><br></p><p>Grandma and Grandpa moved out to a farm when my mother was about 5. They had 40 acres, raised cows, grew alfalfa to feed the cows, and then sold the milk. They had a big, old house with 3 bedrooms and a huge hall where some of the kids slept. They had an outhouse for years, and the lights for the house were kerosene lamps. (Some time after my mom left home after high school, her dad built a new home for her mother.) The community where they lived was called Perrin Colony, where practically everyone was related and were Germans. In my mother’s home, the children all spoke German to their parents.</p><p><br></p><p>My mother went to a two-room schoolhouse, they walked to school, and came home for lunch. The community church was on their property, and they all went to Church regularly. Mom always said she was raised Lutheran. Eventually, they began planting rows of grapes, which they dried into raisins. They would pick the grapes and put them into wooden trays, and lay them out in the sun. Unfortunately, when it looked like rain, they would have to quickly stack all the trays to shield the grapes from the rain. Of course, when the sun came out, all the trays would have to be laid out again. Mom hated all the work on the farm! But she was an Attendant in the Raisin Day Parade when she was 16!</p><p><br></p><p>When Mom graduated from high school, she got a job as a live-in housemaid, where she worked for a couple of years. Her dad would come into town to pick up her paycheck every week. When the family she worked for moved to Los Angeles, she went with them. She helped them get settled, then got a job as a car-hop in Glendale, where she shared an apartment with some girls. She did that for about 3 years, and also went to Beauty College part time. She only had 100 hours left to finish Beauty College when she decided to quit both the car-hop job and Beauty College, and went to work as a waitress at a restaurant called the Arsenal, which was owned and run by Eddie Pope. He was married at the time she started working there, but after he got a divorce, they started dating. After dating for about 5 years, they eloped to Las Vegas, Nevada, and got married. Grandpa died before I was born, at the age of 65. Grandma was 82 when she died, just a couple of months before I graduated from high school. Grandma had a total of 10 children, but 5 of them died as babies. Grandma used to make Grebles, a German donut-like confections fried in oil and dusted with powdered sugar. She also kept a stash of lemon drops by her bed, and she would let me have one sometimes when we were visiting. For several summers, John and I would take the train by ourselves and travel to Fresno to spend a week or two with Grandma. Traveling on the train without parents was quite an adventure! It took about 5 or 6 hours, and our favorite part was the Tehachapi Loop, a place where the train made a complete circle loop to gain elevation. If the train was long enough, you could see the end of the train and the front of the train at the same time. (You can actually see a video of it online!)&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>We always bought a box of Aplete candies, and would sometimes get a bowl of soup or a sandwich to eat in the dining car. When we got to Fresno, we would stay with Grandma and our Aunt Maria (Aunty Rea), who was divorced and living with Grandma, and her 2 daughters, Rea Ann and Karen, who were both younger than we were. Average summer temperatures in Fresno are around 100, but I’m sure they were at least 110-115 whenever we were there! There was no air conditioning, and there was nothing to do but lay around in the shade and eat sunflower seeds. There was a little grocery store about a block and a half away, on the opposite side of the street, but it was very difficult getting there, barefoot, when the pavement was at least 150 degrees! Their yard had tons of hornets, so being outside at all was dangerous! Then after a week or two, we’d get back on the train and go home. Every once in a while, Grandma would come visit us, and that was much nicer. Grandma didn’t talk much because she had difficulty speaking English, but she was so sweet and happy, and I was always glad when she would come visit.</p>
