B: I was under the impression that that was your mom and dad
M: Sure does look like it doesn’t it—when they got married in Russia
B: Just look at them: He was very handsome wasn’t he
M: He was, yes.
B: And how old was he when he died?
M: He wasn’t that old. I don’t know
B: Do you remember how old you were when he died?
M: I wasn’t married yet. I was married in ’41. I think probably in 40.
B: I’m sure I’ve got it written down somewhere.

B: I want you to tell me about your mom and dad. Because grandpa died before I was even born, and I obviously never knew him. So tell me about them. Carl, right. And how did grandma spell her name.
M: Cath… Anna Catherine. They called her Katy.

B: Well, tell me a little bit about her. All I know about grandma is that she made grebels
M: She sure did! Wow, were those ever good! Well, gosh Barbara, it’s hard to talk about it.

B: Well, what about the farm?
M: Didn’t I tell you about the farm before?

B: You said that first they had cows, that they didn’t start out with grapes.
M: I think I was 2 years old when they moved out on the farm. No, no I think 5.

B: So you lived in town for awhile?
M: We lived in town. That’s where they settled when they came in from Russia, and of course none of them could talk English. And so Dad, I don’t know how he got, I don’t know if he went to school or what, but anyway he got his citizenship, and so that made mama automatically a citizen.

B: Neither one could speak English when they came?
M: No. Mom never really did learn English—we would always tease her.

B: She never could write it, you told me.
M: No, and she didn’t speak it very well either.

B: I don’t remember her speaking funny.
M: Really? Well, you never did know her really.

B: Well, yeah, we used to go up to Fresno and spend a week or two. John and I.
M: With Ria Ann. That’s when she was with Maria, when she was quite ill, wasn’t it?

B: I think it was before, because I can remember her making grebbels. And I can remember how hot it was, and John and I would lay out on the the patio, the little porch and pant. I was so hot, we would just pant and pant. And you left us there for a week or two every summer. And we’d go on the train together, and we’d eat those wonderful Applets candy that was covered with powdered sugar. And we’d sit on the porch and eat sunflower seeds. By the bagful. Because there was nothing else to do! So we’d lie there, dying of the heat. And then we’d try to go over to the little corner grocery store. And we were always barefooted, and the pavement was 150 degrees, and you’d run and jump and scream and then you’d have to cross the street, and ohhh, that was something.
M: (laughing) I wasn’t there
B: I know! And there were always hornets around. And when they built on that extra little building on the back, you know, where grandma lived, there were hornets nests out there, too. Ohhh, it was awful!
M: Really…
B: Yeah, we were always afraid of the hornets. And it was hot, hot, hot!
M: Mama was really unhappy when Maria put her out there.

B: What did grandma do all day? As a mother, do you remember, as you were growing up?
M: Of course, we all had to go out in the field and help, not when we were little.

B: But first there were cows.
M: Yes, first there were cows, and then they grew alfalfa for the cows, and they sold the milk, and a truck would come by and pick up the cans of milk.

B: Who did the milking?
M: Kay, and Hank, and then they decided that I should learn how…. (laughing)

B: I remember that Auntie Kay said you were spoiled rotten! Are you the youngest?
M: No, Maria is. But they thought it was time for me to learn how to milk the cow. Well, I fixed it so she kicked me, well she didn’t kick me but she kicked over the bucket.

B: On purpose?
M: Well, of course I did. I wasn’t going to milk a cow! I never did have to milk the cow as far as I can remember. I hurt the cow more than the milk I got out of her. I didn’t know how to do it.

B: How old were you?
M: Well, I was going to grammar school I’m sure. Oh well. The house we had first, it was a long, long house. Not wide, but long. And it had a big bedroom at the end, that was theirs, and then there was another bedroom next, and another bedroom on this side, and then a long, you know it was pretty wide, a long hall next, all the way from one side of the building to the other. And a door on each end. And then came the kitchen, and then there was a little porch, and then there was the bathroom, sort of, what you would call a bathroom. But they had a sink in there, and a stove, not a wood stove, but the other kind. A gas stove, or whatever, and no tub.

B: So how did you take a bath?
M: Well, the tub came later.

B: Well, before the tub, did you have a bucket
M: You know they have these big buckets.

B: Like they show them in pictures?
M: Yeah, right

B: And they have to heat the water and pour it in.
M: Yeah, right, right. One person takes the bath, and then the other one. Maria and I.

B: Who got the hot water?
M: I don’t remember! Oh dear, what a mess! That was our first house. That was on the farm. We had that house even after I left. And then he built Mama a house afterwards. He always told her he would build her a house, so he did before he passed away. We had lots of trees, at the beginning, great big eucalyptus trees, and we were real close to the school. We walked to school, and home for lunch. We always had what we called a ditch, an irrigating ditch, and a bridge across it to come into the yard.

B: How long did they have the cattle before they changed? What made them change?
M: I have no idea.
B: So one day they said, we’ll get rid of the cows…we’re going to grow grapes.
M: They had a barn, a great big barn, and it was just loaded with hay, and they put the cows in there, of course it was separated. Maria, she was very acrobatic, she was always doing something, she would get up in the hay. I don’t remember doing it…I would always say “you do it”. I don’t know if I ever did, slide down that hay. An then at times they had the window, and I think this is how I remember it, we would have a wagon full of hay, ready to be pitched in, you know, she’d jump out into the wagon of hay. She was really somethin’. Oh gosh, at 5 years old you don’t remember that much. I just really remember that we did have to go out and help, we’d have to be 10, ll, 12 to do those things with the pitchforks. Put the hay all together, we didn’t have to put it up into the wagon, but we did help. Then they started planting,..they didn’t stop altogether on the cows and stuff, they just took certain acres. We had 40 acres, so they just took strips of land and started with grapes, and kept increasing. But talking about sunflower seeds, this house that we had for so long, it was a long house, I think it was real long. Then we had dirt, we didn’t have cement, it was a real hard dirt that we had to sweep down all the time, and hose it down, whenever we had company, and we had a bunch of flowers out there, we had a real lovely garden. And anyway, whenever they had company, they would sit outside, and they would chew seeds all night long, and of course the first thing we had to do the next day, we had to sweep all those seeds and stuff off the dirt, we had to sweep the whole thing, and we did that so many times. I’ll never forget that part. I like seeds too, but I haven’t been eating them lately. I love them.

B: I do too. Why do you think I have grooves in my teeth? Well, tell me about the grapes, the raisins.
M: Oh, another thing we had was a kitchen. A summer kitchen they called it. It was another long thing. But it had cement floors, and window screens all around it so the air could go through. Eventually they did something with it, I can’t remember.

B: What did they do in there?
M: We ate out there during the summer while everybody was working. They were dirty, and would come in. We had a long table we would sit at. I can’t remember if they had people helping them or not. Mama would cook for everyone. I can’t remember that at all. Eventually, when they got all the grapes going, when the raisins were dried enough, we didn’t use the kitchen anymore. They used that for storing the grapes until they were sold. They just dumped them all in there, and then they had to put wood or something around it. I wish I could remember it. The hardest work of all on the farm was when we would have to go out there, we’d have to get the weeds out.

B: Well, did you have to pick the grapes?
M: Of course! We had to pick the grapes and put them on a tray, and at that time we just had wooden trays, like the one you gave me, and you get them out there.

B: Did you have to take the individual grapes off the stem?
M: Oh no, no. We took the whole bunches and laid them on..And then when they get to a certain color and texture and everything, then you have to take another tray, and put it on top of that, and flip them over, so then it will be on the other side.

B: And they’re still in bunches, at that point?
M: Oh , yeah. So then, of course you have to pick the darn things, too. Before we even do that when they first grow up, after the grapes are all picked, around wintertime, then they’d go out and prune them, and you have to wire them up, and we had to do that, and that was so hard, that was so hard. So anyway, going back to the trays, you had to flip them all the way down the row, and the next row, and the next row. It was back braking. Then, every time it looked like it was going to rain, we’d have to go out and stack them up as high as we could, all of them. Not just one row, but all of them. Then after the sun was out again, and it looked like it was going to be clear, we’d have to spread them all out again. What a chore, what a chore.

B: Did you leave them out at night?
M: Oh yes.

B: When did you take them off the trays?
M: When they were good and dry. And you put them in boxes.
And you have a tray something like that but it’s all the way around, I mean it has a side all the way around, with chicken wire close together. And you get in there and shake it, and shake it, and shake it, and try to get all those little stems and leaves and stuff off of them, or you pick them out. Then you dump them all in a big box and you stack those. Then you gather them up and take them into the old kitchen we had. I think they used to stir them, or just stoke them, or whatever, and it seems to me that they even sprayed them a little. They left them in there till the price had gone up a little bit. They could wait because they weren’t spoiling or anything, so they’d wait till they thought they had a good price for it. Then they’d have to haul them into town, and they’d get all weighed, then they’d come back home and get another load. They didn’t make much money, but they made enough to keep going. Later on they didn’t have wooden trays any more, so we just had one wooden tray, and we put paper on it, and put the grapes on the paper part, and when you get that full, you slide it off into the row, and it’s always up sort of, the high part of the row, so that the sun hits it like that. It was a certain kind of paper that they used.

B: How did you flip them?
M: Boy, that was the hardest part. You just had to put another paper over it, and flip them. You really had to know how to flip them.

B: How back-breaking. How did you stack them if it was going to rain.
M: Oh, you couldn’t stack them, you had to roll them.
B: Wow. So that’s why you left the farm?
M: You bet!
B: How old were you when you left?
M: After I graduated, which must have been around 18.
B: That’s when you took off.
M: No, no, I didn’t take off. I went to town and did house work for
some people.
B: Did you live on the farm?
M: No, I stayed there with them in their house. And my Dad would come there all the time to get my money.
B: He took your money?
M: Yeah. My checks. In fact, I don’t think I was even 18 yet. And then they moved down to Glendale, from Fresno to Glendale, and they asked my folks if I could come down with them and help them get settled, and they said yes. And I never went back. I went back, but I mean I didn’t stay.
B: So how much longer did you work for them?
M: I think it was just till they got settled and I got a job.
B: What was your first job?
M: It was car-hopping.
B: But you didn’t wear roller skates, did you?
M: No. (laughing)

B: You know, you never did tell me about your dad.
M: I know. He was nice. He didn’t talk much. And we knew when he said no it meant no. And if we ever wanted anything we’d always go to Mama. And she’d most always get what we wanted. Boy, we were sort of afraid of him because he was very stern.

B: He doesn’t look very stern in this picture. Did he have blond hair?
M: Yeah, kind of. I think Maria said that his family had a little money. I don’t know if she said that they started to send him to college. He was very smart. He could do anything. He was a street lighter when he was working.

B: I think Maria told me that he was a street lighter, and also was a mason, and did a lot of the masonry work around town.
M: And everybody came to him out on the farm to ask what to do about certain things. He was very, very talented. We had a church right on our land, you know, at the end of the road. We’d have to walk over to church. We’d walk through the fields. He was superintendent, or whatever you call it, for the school.

B: So he was involved in a lot of thing besides the farming?
M: Yes. He helped everybody.

B: The Grandma that I knew was always sweet.
M: Yes she was. And she had the most beautiful skin all the time. Oh gosh, I’d get such a kick out of every time she’d come down to visit I’d always get her some makeup, so she could take good care
of her skin. She had beautiful skin.

B: That must be where you got your beautiful skin.
M: She loved hats. She had more hats!

B: I don’t ever remember that!
M: She’d always wear them. Whenever she’d come down I’d always buy her a new dress and some hats. She had more hats in her closet!

B: Well, tell me something about your brothers and sisters.
M: Carl was the oldest. And he was pretty smart, but didn’t do much.

B: What did he do for a living?
M: I don’t even know. Of course he worked on the farm. He helped. I don’t know if he sent off for a radio that you had to put together, but he did put one together, and we were about the only one that had one. And he was very…I don’t know what to say

B: He always seemed very somber. Uncle Carl and Aunt Viola always
seemed stiff.
M: Well, my dad was sort of that way. But Mama was the jolly one. Then there was Hank. No, I think Kay was before Hank. And she went to Seattle, and was there most of her life, I guess. That’s where she met Lyle. At a dance. She loved to dance. She would go by herself, and she met him at the dance, and eventually they got married. And they never had any kids. I don’t know if she ever had problems or what. She was quite old by the time she married.

B: So what’s the deal with Hank?
M: He was on the farm helping, too. But he was the black sheep of the family. He especially liked to drink. I guess he left home a couple of times and then he’d come back. And then when Dad passed away, Mama put up with it for awhile, and he wasn’t taking care of the farm, so Mama decided to sell the place and move into town.

B: Is that the house she moved to? That we knew?
M: I think so, I think it is. I think Maria sold it after Mama passed away. I think they took the property later for a freeway or something.

B: So what did Hank do after Grandma moved to town?
M: He just worked for other people, then he’d get drunk, and not show up for awhile. We didn’t have much contact with him for all those years. He just had a little house, probably beer bottles all over the place. He never got married. Till his dying day, he had throat cancer, he was always smoking, and he still had to have beer, or whatever he drank, he drank hard liquor too, even his buddies brought it into where he was. He was in some kind of a home or hospital, and they would sneak it in. They caught him at it, so they made him move to some other place. Maria had to take the brunt of everything because he was there in Fresno. So Maria at the time, I think when Mama moved, Maria was still living with Tom Lynch.

B: I can remember going to their house, part way out of town, and then we’d go in to see Grandma.
M: Then she moved in with Mama, and then when she got real sick, Mama, that was hard because she only had one bedroom, I think. But Maria had 2 kids, and then when Mama got real sick, Eddie and I helped fix up that back part, and moved her out there. That made her so unhappy, but she was real sick. Maria was working, and then we would hire someone to come in and stay with her, when she was real bad. She passed away when John was in college, and I went up when they called me. I went up by myself, and then Eddie and you came, and rented an apartment, or a little cabin or something. We didn’t stay at Mama’s—she didn’t have the room.

B: I thought we just stayed in a motel.
M: Yeah, a motel. I can still see it. When you got there, I came back with you. And John was there. I was so surprised, I didn’t know he was coming. And you met Hank there at the house after the funeral. Remember?

B: No
M: You don’t? He was pretty sober, and he went out, and you and John went out and talked to him on the steps for a long time. You came back in and said, “Hank’s real nice.” You don’t remember that at all? And I just kept worrying while you were sitting out there with him, but you guys came back in after awhile.

B: I don’t remember that at all. I remember Grandma’s funeral, and I remember the motel. But I don’t remember Hank. I’ll have to think about that. I remember there were a lot of people at the house.
M: And he went out. I don’t know if he went out for a smoke, probably, and you guys went out and talked to him. He just hit the bottle all the time.

B: Do you have a picture of him?
M: I don’t think we do.

B: I don’t think I’ve ever seen a picture of him
M: We have one of Carl and you, a nice picture. When we had the house with the swimming pool. Remember at the end of the pool, a real nice picture of you and Carl.

B: I remember Carl. I remember his funeral
M: I remember the times we had to take John, because he had asthma so badly, and we ended up in Arizona.

B: Did we go to Arizona? It seemed like we always went to Mohave.
M: Oh we did. Not only Mohave. We had a big, I think it’s called a vat for the wine, about so high. I seems to me like, I don’t know if I’m just dreaming, I think that we used to get in and stomp on the grapes.

B: You see that in the movies
M: I think we really did that. Dad always had a drink of wine, always had a glass of wine with dinner. But we never did.

B: Maybe that’s what happened to Hank.
M: Maybe. Of course they used to make beer, too. Mostly wine, though. With certain kind of grapes. Not the kind that we sold and dried. They were the big, I think they were called Malaga grapes. They were a real dark color.

<p>B: I was under the impression that that was your mom and dad</p><p>M: Sure does look like it doesn’t it—when they got married in Russia</p><p>B: Just look at them: He was very handsome wasn’t he</p><p>M: He was, yes.</p><p>B: And how old was he when he died?</p><p>M: He wasn’t that old.

We took the whole bunches and laid them on..And then when they get to a certain color and texture and everything, then you have to take another tray, and put it on top of that, and flip them over, so then it will be on the other side.</p><p><br></p><p>B: And they’re still in bunches, at that point?</p><p>M: Oh , yeah. So then, of course you have to pick the darn things, too. Before we even do that when they first grow up, after the grapes are all picked, around wintertime, then they’d go out and  prune them, and you have to wire them up, and we had to do that, and that was so hard, that was so hard. So anyway, going back to the trays, you had to flip them all the way down the row, and the next row, and the next row. It was back braking. Then, every time it looked like it was going to rain, we’d have to go out and stack them up as high as we could, all of them. Not just one row, but all of them. Then after the sun was out again, and it looked like it was going to be clear, we’d have to spread them all out again. What a chore, what a chore.</p><p><br></p><p>B: Did you leave them out at night?</p><p>M: Oh yes.</p><p><br></p><p>B: When did you take them off the trays?</p><p>M: When they were good and dry. And you put them in boxes.</p><p>And you have a tray something like that but it’s all the way around, I mean it has a side all the way around, with chicken wire close together. And you get in there and shake it, and shake it, and shake it, and try to get all those little stems and leaves and stuff off of them, or you pick them out. Then you dump them all in a big box and you stack those. Then you gather them up and take them into the old kitchen we had. I think they used to stir them, or just stoke them, or whatever, and it seems to me that they even sprayed them a little. They left them in there till the price had gone up a little bit. They could wait because they weren’t spoiling or anything, so they’d wait till they thought they had a good price for it. Then they’d have to haul them into town, and they’d get all weighed, then they’d come back home and get another load. They didn’t make much money, but they made enough to keep going. Later on they didn’t have wooden trays any more, so we just had one wooden tray, and we put paper on it, and put the grapes on the paper part, and when you get that full, you slide it off into the row, and it’s always up sort of, the high part of the row, so that the sun hits it like that. It was a certain kind of paper that they used.</p><p><br></p><p>B: How did you flip them?</p><p>M: Boy, that was the hardest part. You just had to put another paper over it, and flip them. You really had to know how to flip them.</p><p><br></p><p>B: How back-breaking. How did you stack them if it was going to rain.</p><p>M: Oh, you couldn’t stack them, you had to roll them.</p><p>B: Wow. So that’s why you left the farm?</p><p>M: You bet!</p><p>B: How old were you when you left?</p><p>M: After I graduated, which must have been around 18.</p><p>B: That’s when you took off.</p><p>M: No, no, I didn’t take off. I went to town and did house work for</p><p>some people.</p><p>B: Did you live on the farm?</p><p>M: No, I stayed there with them in their house. And my Dad would come there all the time to get my money.</p><p>B: He took your money?</p><p>M: Yeah. My checks. In fact, I don’t think I was even 18 yet. And then they moved down to Glendale, from Fresno to Glendale, and they asked my folks if I could come down with them and help them get settled, and they said yes. And I never went back. I went back, but I mean I didn’t stay.</p><p>B: So how much longer did you work for them?</p><p>M: I think it was just till they got settled and I got a job.</p><p>B: What was your first job?</p><p>M: It was car-hopping.</p><p>B: But you didn’t wear roller skates, did you?</p><p>M: No. (laughing)</p><p><br></p><p>B: You know, you never did tell me about your dad.</p><p>M: I know. He was nice. He didn’t talk much. And we knew when he said no it meant no. And if we ever wanted anything we’d always go to Mama. And she’d most always get what we wanted. Boy, we were sort of afraid of him because he was very stern.</p><p><br></p><p>B: He doesn’t look very stern in this picture. Did he have blond hair?</p><p>M: Yeah, kind of. I think Maria said that his family had a little money. I don’t know if she said that they started to send him to college. He was very smart. He could do anything. He was a street lighter when he was working.</p><p><br></p><p>B: I think Maria told me that he was a street lighter, and also was a mason, and did a lot of the masonry work around town.</p><p>M: And everybody came to him out on the farm to ask what to do about certain things. He was very, very talented. We had a church right on our land, you know, at the end of the road. We’d have to walk over to church. We’d walk through the fields. He was superintendent, or whatever you call it, for the school.</p><p><br></p><p>B: So he was involved in a lot of thing besides the farming?</p><p>M: Yes. He helped everybody.</p><p><br></p><p>B: The Grandma that I knew was always sweet.</p><p>M: Yes she was. And she had the most beautiful skin all the time. Oh gosh, I’d get such a kick out of every time she’d come down to visit I’d always get her some makeup, so she could take good care</p><p>of her skin. She had beautiful skin.</p><p><br></p><p>B: That must be where you got your beautiful skin.</p><p>M: She loved hats. She had more hats!</p><p><br></p><p>B: I don’t ever remember that!</p><p>M: She’d always wear them. Whenever she’d come down I’d always buy her a new dress and some hats. She had more hats in her closet!</p><p><br></p><p>B: Well, tell me something about your brothers and sisters.</p><p>M: Carl was the oldest. And he was pretty smart, but didn’t do much.</p><p><br></p><p>B: What did he do for a living?</p><p>M: I don’t even know. Of course he worked on the farm. He helped. I don’t know if he sent off for a radio that you had to put together, but he did put one together, and we were about the only one that had one. And he was very…I don’t know what to say</p><p><br></p><p>B: He always seemed very somber. Uncle Carl and Aunt Viola always</p><p>seemed stiff.</p><p>M: Well, my dad was sort of that way. But Mama was the jolly one. Then there was Hank. No, I think Kay was before Hank. And she went to Seattle, and was there most of her life, I guess. That’s where she met Lyle. At a dance. She loved to dance. She would go by herself, and she met him at the dance, and eventually they got married. And they never had any kids. I don’t know if she ever had problems or what. She was quite old by the time she married.</p><p><br></p><p>B: So what’s the deal with Hank?</p><p>M: He was on the farm helping, too. But he was the black sheep of the family. He especially liked to drink. I guess he left home a couple of times and then he’d come back. And then when Dad passed away, Mama put up with it for awhile, and he wasn’t taking care of the farm, so Mama decided to sell the place and move into town.</p><p><br></p><p>B: Is that the house she moved to? That we knew?</p><p>M: I think so, I think it is. I think Maria sold it after Mama passed away. I think they took the property later for a freeway or something.</p><p><br></p><p>B: So what did Hank do after Grandma moved to town?</p><p>M: He just worked for other people, then he’d get drunk, and not show up for awhile. We didn’t have much contact with him for all those years. He just had a little house, probably beer bottles all over the place. He never got married. Till his dying day, he had throat cancer, he was always smoking, and he still had to have beer, or whatever he drank, he drank hard liquor too, even his buddies brought it into where he was. He was in some kind of a home or hospital, and they would sneak it in. They caught him at it, so they made him move to some other place. Maria had to take the brunt of everything because he was there in Fresno. So Maria at the time, I think when Mama moved, Maria was still living with Tom Lynch.</p><p><br></p><p>B: I can remember going to their house, part way out of town, and then we’d go in to see Grandma.</p><p>M: Then she moved in with Mama, and then when she got real sick, Mama, that was hard because she only had one bedroom, I think. But Maria had 2 kids, and then when Mama got real sick, Eddie and I helped fix up that back part, and moved her out there. That made her so unhappy, but she was real sick. Maria was working, and then we would hire someone to come in and stay with her, when she was real bad. She passed away when John was in college, and I went up when they called me. I went up by myself, and then Eddie and you came, and rented an apartment, or a little cabin or something. We didn’t stay at Mama’s—she didn’t have the room.</p><p><br></p><p>B: I thought we just stayed in a motel.</p><p>M: Yeah, a motel. I can still see it. When you got there, I came back with you. And John was there. I was so surprised, I didn’t know he was coming. And you met Hank there at the house after the funeral. Remember?</p><p><br></p><p>B: No</p><p>M: You don’t? He was pretty sober, and he went out, and you and John went out and talked to him on the steps for a long time. You came back in and said, “Hank’s real nice.” You don’t remember that at all? And I just kept worrying while you were sitting out there with him, but you guys came back in after awhile.</p><p><br></p><p>B: I don’t remember that at all. I remember Grandma’s funeral, and I remember the motel. But I don’t remember Hank. I’ll have to think about that. I remember there were a lot of people at the house.</p><p>M: And he went out. I don’t know if he went out for a smoke, probably, and you guys went out and talked to him. He just hit the bottle all the time.</p><p><br></p><p>B: Do you have a picture of him?</p><p>M: I don’t think we do.</p><p><br></p><p>B: I don’t think I’ve ever seen a picture of him</p><p>M: We have one of Carl and you, a nice picture. When we had the house with the swimming pool. Remember at the end of the pool, a real nice picture of you and Carl.</p><p><br></p><p>B: I remember Carl. I remember his funeral</p><p>M: I remember the times we had to take John, because he had asthma so badly, and we ended up in Arizona.</p><p><br></p><p>B: Did we go to Arizona? It seemed like we always went to Mohave.</p><p>M: Oh we did. Not only Mohave. We had a big, I think it’s called a vat for the wine, about so high. I seems to me like, I don’t know if I’m just dreaming, I think that we used to get in and stomp on the grapes.</p><p><br></p><p>B: You see that in the movies</p><p>M: I think we really did that. Dad always had a drink of wine, always had a glass of wine with dinner. But we never did.</p><p><br></p><p>B: Maybe that’s what happened to Hank.</p><p>M: Maybe. Of course they used to make beer, too. Mostly wine, though. With certain kind of grapes. Not the kind that we sold and dried. They were the big, I think they were called Malaga grapes. They were a real dark color.</p>
